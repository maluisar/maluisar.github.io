    The accelerated pace at which technology is taking over every single industry has created a nostalgic feeling that makes our society want to go back to the old ways; Organic and non-gmo labels are demanded by consumers, retailers take pride in selling local and hand-made items, and people prefer walking.

    In this paradoxical environment where simple, clean and efficient coexists with artisanal and environmentaly friendly, a style is shining in the interior design world - <strong>Mexican Modernism</strong>.
