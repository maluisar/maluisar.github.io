    <h1>Mexican Modernism</h1>
    <p>
    In the US and the world, techonology has been taking over every single industry. Even industries that we never thought would be affected by it are being disrupted. However, in this macro-trend towards innovation, a need to go back to our roots has been growing in our society; Organic and non-gmo labels are demanded by consumers, retailers take pride in selling local and hand-made items, and driving a car has become the least popular mean for transportation.

    In this paradoxical environment where simple, clean and efficient coexists with artisanal and environmentaly friendly, a style is shining in the interior design world, <strong>Mexican Modernism</strong>.

    When we think about Mexican style, what comes to mind is really a fusion of Spanish esthetic with native Mexican tradition that gives life to colorful and cozy spaces filled with elements in natural materials like wood, organic textiles, clay and stones.

    With this history of influence in the culture, it's not surprising that Mexico is integrating its neighbor's style preferences to its own. Creating a style that appeals to the US market.
